 ##ROUTING


 Redirect -> server component (used for redirecting after submit form or logins)
    We can use it in next.config.js to redirect an incoming request path to a different destination path

 useRouter -> client component (just simple navigations)

 window.history.pushState -> modify url & browser's history without  reload

 window.history.replaceState -> Same like pushState but it replace current history entry with new state & URL in browser history stack

 prefetch -> preload route before user visit

 ** try error.js & loading.js

 streaming -> ability to send parts of a response to the client as they are generated, rather than waiting for the entire response to be ready.

 use _folder to create private folder (not routable)

 Parallel Routes -> simultaneously or conditionally render one or more pages within the same layout. (can be used to create modals too)

 Intercepting Routes ->  load a route from another part of your application within the current layout. Uses this = (..) or (.) or (...) in foldername

 (Learn middleware and create backend of typeintel with Nextjs!!)
